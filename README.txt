Bayes-Classifiers

This repository consists of a group of programs for the simulation of Baye's Classifiers taught 
in the course CS-669 (Pattern Recognition) in IIT Mandi, Fall semester, 2017.

The programs are contained in the directory /src/py

To run the programs, use python2. (example command - "python bayes_classifier_a.py")

There are four programs _a,_b,_c and _d whose specifications are mentioned in the programs themselves.
You'll be instructed what to do once you run the program.

The input directory is /data/Input
You can put more data in the prescribed format and run the programs for it.

The output directory is /data/Output
It will contain images of graphs plotted by the programs for future reference.
The plotting will be granular given the amount of data to be processed,
but it will give a good idea of the classification done.

The program takes some to generate all graphs so be patient for a couple of minutes.
It should work as mentioned, if all the inputs are fine.
